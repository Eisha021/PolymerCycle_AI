# ♻️ PolymerCycle AI  
**Applied AI for Polymer Sustainability & Circular Economy**

PolymerCycle AI is a lightweight, web-based decision-support tool that uses Generative AI to provide **practical, chemistry-aware guidance** on polymer identification, recyclability, and sustainability pathways.  
The project was developed during an international hackathon to address real-world challenges in plastic waste management and polymer upcycling.

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Despite the global push toward a circular plastic economy, **critical polymer knowledge remains inaccessible** to many students, early-stage researchers, and small-scale waste processors.  

Key challenges include:
- Difficulty identifying polymer types in consumer products  
- Limited understanding of recyclability constraints  
- High contamination in recycling streams due to misclassification  

This knowledge gap leads to **downcycling, material loss, and inefficient recycling decisions**.

---

## 💡 Solution
**PolymerCycle AI** bridges this gap by acting as a **virtual polymer science assistant**.

Users can input the name of a plastic product (e.g., *plastic bottle*, *food packaging film*), and the app provides:
- Likely polymer type(s)
- Basic resin identification guidance
- Recyclability considerations
- Sustainability-oriented recommendations

The tool does **not propose new recycling technologies**. Instead, it supports **better decision-making** using existing polymer science knowledge—making expertise more accessible.

## 🧪 How It Works
1. User enters a plastic product name  
2. The system prompts a large language model with **polymer-specific context**  
3. The model returns structured, chemistry-informed guidance  
4. Output is displayed in real time via a clean web interface
